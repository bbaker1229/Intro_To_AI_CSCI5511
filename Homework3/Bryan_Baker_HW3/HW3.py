'''
othellogame module

sets up an Othello game closely following the book's framework for games

OthelloState is a class that will handle our state representation, then we've 
got stand-alone functions for player, actions, result and terminal_test

Differing from the book's framework, is that utility is *not* a stand-alone 
function, as each player might have their own separate way of calculating utility
